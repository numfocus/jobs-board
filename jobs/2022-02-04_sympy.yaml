# Description

The TU Delft Bicycle Lab is seeking a postdoctoral researcher for a 1
year equivalent contract (full or part time). You will work on a
sub-project of [SymPy\'s \"Improving Foundational Open Source Symbolic
Mathematics for Science\"
grant](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/sympy-improving-foundational-open-source-symbolic-mathematics-for-science/)
funded by the [Chan-Zuckerberg Foundation's "Essential Open Source
Software for Science\"
program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-16-million-for-foundational-open-source-software-tools-essential-to-biomedicine/).
The purpose of the overall grant is to improve the SymPy Python symbolic
mathematics library in the key areas of performance, code generation,
and documentation. The [full grant
proposal](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16590053.v1) is available
publicly on Figshare.

We believe SymPy is the most widely used general purpose open source
computer algebra system (CAS). The software is over 16 years old and has
over 800k downloads per month on PyPi. It is a full featured CAS, with
over 700k lines of Python code. [The SymPy paper (Meurer, Aaron, et al.
\"SymPy: Symbolic computing in Python.\" PeerJ Computer Science 3
(2017): e103.)](http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.103) describes the
software and some of its uses.

Code generation plays a central role in SymPy's roadmap for supporting
scientific codes. The code generation roadmap prioritizes usability,
generating high performance code, and supporting a wide array of
languages. This postdoctoral research project will focus on improving
usability and performance of code generation guided by a performance
critical musculoskeletal model application. This model will be adopted
from a bicycle vehicle model and a human upper body and arm model. This
human-vehicle model includes stiff dynamics, holonomic and nonholonomic
constraints, thousands of algebraic operations, and complex force
definitions; all features that strain SymPy's ability to best
competitors in advanced biomechanical simulations.

The postdoctoral research project has two primary outcomes:

1.  Improve SymPy's numerical code generation capabilities for general
    use cases.
2.  Develop a musculoskeletal driven bicycle model that demonstrates
    domain specific improvements to the code generation capabilities of
    SymPy.

The developed software will be contributed to SymPy as open source
software (BSD) and the modeling results will be submitted to appropriate
scientific journals.

You will simultaneously work as a member of the TU Delft Bicycle Lab and
the SymPy development team. You will work with BSc, MSc, and PhD
candidates in the lab as well as members of the SymPy community. You
will work with and be directly mentored by Jason K. Moore.

This position offers flexible work hours, the possibility of remote work
(country dependent), and the possibility of full or part time work.

Opportunities for growing your academic career will be available, such
as mentoring BSc/MSc Students and PhD candidates, conference
presentations, networking, teaching, and grant writing.

# Requirements

You should have:

-   A STEM Ph.D. by the start date of the position
-   Proficiency with the Python programming language
-   Good written and oral communication skills in English

The following skills will help you stand out:

-   Open source software contribution best practices and experience
-   Experience with SymPy
-   Experience with symbolic computation, numerical computing, and/or
    code generation
-   Experience with C/C++ or Fortran
-   Computational multibody dynamics experience
-   Musculoskeletal modeling experience

Keep in mind that this describes the background we imagine would best
fit the role. Even if you do not meet all of the requirements and feel
that you are up for the task, we absolutely want to see your
application!

# Diversity and Inclusion

The TU Delft Bicycle Lab and SymPy are committed to advancing diversity,
equity, and inclusion efforts across open source software development
with this position, aligning with CZI's goals. We especially encourage
applicants from underrepresented groups in open source software to
apply.

TU Delft values a safe, inclusive and diverse work environment. To
reinforce that, we have committed ourselves to the joint [Statement
Social Safety](https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB/news.html/nieuwsbericht/512) of
the Association of Universities in the Netherlands and the [National
Action Plan for Diversity and
Inclusion](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/09/01/nieuw-nationaal-actieplan-voor-diversiteit-en-inclusie).
In addition to that, we have a Social Safety Programme.

# To Apply

Submit (in PDF format) a 1 page cover letter explaining your motivation
and fit for the position, a C.V., one example peer reviewed scientific
publication where you are the primary author, and examples of your
Python software development proficiency (URLs to public code are
encouraged).
