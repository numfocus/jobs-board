It enables users to manage and process array data in open standard cloud-native formats, with features like versioning, cataloging, collaboration and access control on top. Arraylake was built to integrate seamlessly with the open source scientific Python ecosystem, and provides an interface via the [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) project. Through the [Zarr interface](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), scientific data users interact with data via libraries such as [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/), [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Cooler](https://cooler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Napari](https://napari.org/), and others.\n\nOur team has deep experience developing and maintaining open source software libraries across the scientific Python ecosystem. We’re now looking to expand the team to include a focus on building and supporting Xarray *specifically for the biomedical research community (Note: t*his position will be partially funded by a grant from the Chan Chan Zuckerberg Initiative).\n\nEarthmover values a diverse workplace and **strongly** encourages women, people of color, LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, and veterans to apply. We want *you*.\n\n**Job Description**:\n\nThis role will focus on building connections, both technical and social, between the Xarray project and the biomedical research community. We want you to join the Earthmover team to do a mix of technical engineering work and community stewarding, serving the needs of biomedical researchers in fields like microscopy, genomics, and neurophysiology.\n\n**Responsibilities**:\n\nWe expect this role to be\n\n- 50% Targeted feature development, integration work, and maintenance work aimed at accelerating the adoption of Xarray across the biomedical community. There are a number of high-impact projects in the queue waiting for an eager developer to jump in.\n- 30% Outreach (office hours, blog posts, conferences).\n- 20% Community coordination and support (integration support, issue triage)\n\n**You’re a great fit if you**\n\n- Have experience developing open source projects in the Scientific Python ecosystem like NumPy, Pandas, Xarray, Dask, and/or Zarr. Bonus points if you’ve already been contributing to an open source project.\n- Have a background that intersects with one or more biomedical research areas. This could include prior research experience and/or supporting research in a data science, data engineering, and/or software engineering capacity.\n- Have a passion for seeing community software projects thrive.\n- Want to help the the biomedical research community use open software and open data to solve hard problems.\n\n**Our open source stack**:\n\n- [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/) is the focus of this hire. It provides a high-level data model and API for working with labeled N-dimensional arrays. Think of it it like Pandas for multidimensional data.\n- [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) is a community developed data format for chunked, compressed multidimensional arrays. Zarr-Python is the interface to Zarr used by Xarray, Arraylake, and many other libraries.\n- Both Xarray and Zarr are built to integrate with the rest of the Scientific Python ecosystem. Think NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Dask, Matplotlib, etc.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n- Company equity\n- Health insurance through UnitedHealthcare - up to 99% of premium covered for employee under basic plan\n- 20 days of PTO annually with a quarterly time off minimum\n- 10 personal days annually\n- 7 paid company holidays\n- 12 weeks of paid family leave\n- Quarterly company off-sites\n\nEarthmover is an equal-opportunity employer.
